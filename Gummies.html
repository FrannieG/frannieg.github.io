							<h1> Fruit </h1>
							<h2>Ingredients</h2>
							<p> - 8 tablespoons gelatin powder
							- 1/4 cup honey or maple syrup
							- 2 cups fruit jucie
							- 1 cup defrosted frozen berries</p>	
							<h2> Directions</h2>
							<p>1.Note: It is important to have all ingredients ready before beginning as you'll need to work quickly once you start.</p> <p> 2.Place fruit juice or kombucha and honey/maple syrup in a small saucepan and heat over low heat until warm and starting to simmer but not hot or boiling. Add pureed fruit, if using.</p> <p> 3.Start sprinkling gelatin over the juice mixture while whisking or using an immersion blender. Continue doing this until all gelatin is incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Adding the gelatin too quickly will make it more difficult to get the mixture to incorporate. An immersion blender is not necessary but greatly speeds up the process.</p> <p>4.As soon as the gelatin is mixed in and the mixture is smooth, pour into molds or a lined/greased baking dish and place in the refrigerator or freezer until hardened.</p>
